# Profile Card

A small, responsive profile card component built with HTML and CSS (optionally JavaScript). Designed for use in landing pages, portfolios, or UI component libraries.

## Features
- Responsive layout
- Avatar, name, title, bio, and social links
- Easy to customize (colors, spacing, fonts)
- Lightweight — no frameworks required

## Demo
Open `index.html` in a browser to view the component locally.
You can also run it using a local development server (for example, VS Code Live Server or Python’s http.server) to ensure JavaScript features like the live time and avatar upload work correctly.

## Installation

git clone https://github.com/Vortex105/hng-profile-card
cd hng-profile-card
open index.html
```


## Customization
- Change colors in `:root` (CSS variables)
- Swap avatar image in `assets/`
- Adjust font-family in `styles.css`
- Add simple interactions with `script.js` (optional)
